# Static Comp Challenge 3

Our assignment for this challenge was to recreate a website based off of an image. The image they gave us had a website that was in a desktop format, so the mobile and large screen format was up to each student. We were allowed to take liberties with the content of the website but not the format. Below I have the image I was tasked to recreate and the webpage I made.
